# Advanced Digital Design ENCS3310 - Course Project

## Project Overview
This project involves designing an Arithmetic Unit (AU) and verifying its functionality using Verilog. The unit will be built using two different types of adders: a ripple carry adder and a carry look-ahead adder. The project will be executed in two stages, each increasing in complexity and performance optimization.

## Objective
- Design a 4-bit Arithmetic Unit using structural Verilog.
- Implement and compare two types of adders: ripple carry and carry look-ahead.
- Verify the functionality and performance of the Arithmetic Unit.
- Analyze and report the maximum latency and operational frequency of the AU.

## Project Stages
### Stage 1
- Implement the Arithmetic Unit using ripple carry adders.
- Complete functional verification to demonstrate working.
- Determine maximum latency and corresponding maximum clock frequency.
- Introduce and detect a design error through verification.

### Stage 2
- Upgrade the AU by replacing the ripple carry adder with a carry look-ahead adder.
- Perform simulations to validate the improved performance.
- Analyze the enhanced maximum latency and frequency.
- Introduce and identify an error in the new design.
